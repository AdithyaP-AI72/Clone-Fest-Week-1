### üìù **Problem Statement: Modernizing Chyrp**

**Background:** Chyrp is a lightweight, extensible blogging engine originally written to be simple yet powerful. It allowed bloggers to publish content in multiple formats (‚ÄúFeathers‚Äù), extend functionality via modules, and customize appearance with themes. While innovative in its time, Chyrp now feels outdated compared to today‚Äôs modern, responsive, API-driven web applications.

Your challenge in this hackathon is to rebuild Chyrp as a modern web application that preserves its flexibility and lightweight philosophy while implementing its key features.
